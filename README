xmpp_publisher
===============

This project delivers a command line tool which is capable of creating items
on nodes, in case the node doesn't exist, it'll create it for the user.  This tool 
can be used for functional testing of applications which publish XMPP events.


Scope

This program allows you to publish to a node that is specified in the 
arguments and it will create that node in case it is not in the system.
